# GitHubFinder_ArchExamples

## About

**GitHubFinder_ArchExamples** is a collection of practical examples implementing various iOS architecture patterns, including **MVVM**, **TCA (The Composable Architecture)**, **RIBs**, **ReactorKit**, and more.  
This repository utilizes a variety of third-party libraries, such as **RxSwift**, **Combine**, **RxFlow**, **RxDataSource**, **SnapKit**, **PinLayout**, and **FlexLayout**, to demonstrate their application within each architecture.  

Each example is tailored to its respective architecture, incorporating the libraries and tools best suited to its needs.
For a detailed breakdown of the libraries used and their implementations, please refer to the Architecture-Specific Descriptions provided in the repository.

## ⚙️ Framework / Architecture

### SwiftUI



<details>
<summary>TCA (The Composable Architecture) 🚧 In Progress</summary>

#### TCA (The Composable Architecture)

This section is currently a work in progress.  
More details and examples will be added soon. 🚀

<!-- Add details, explanations, and code snippets for TCA here -->

### UIKit

<details>
<summary>MVVM - C (Model-View-ViewModel with Coordinator)</summary>

### MVVM - C (Model-View-ViewModel with Coordinator)

##### MVVM-C is an extension of the MVVM architecture where the Coordinator pattern is introduced to manage navigation and decouple flow logic from the ViewModel.

#### 📦 SPM (Swift Package Manager)
- Then
- Moya
- SnapKit
- RxSwift
- Kingfisher

#### 🔧 Design Patterns
- Coordinator: Manages app navigation in a decoupled way.
- Singleton: Provides shared instances for commonly used components.
- Input/Output: Ensures unidirectional data flow between the View and ViewModel.
